# 💰 Alma's Finance Tracker
📊 Finance tracker with charts

✨ This project focuses on tracking income and expenses, group expenses by categories, and generate charts. You  should be able to take in inputs (income and list of expenses in $) either via inputs from users or CSV and perform various actions like either showing the remaining balance after the total expenditure and group the expenses in different categories or showing the expenses as charts.
